## About

> ***It soon became clear that the unconscious instincts for logic and language which had enabled me to succeed were not shared by the large majority of my students.*** - Susanna Epp (author of [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC))

Solutions to Susanna Epp's [Discrete Mathematics 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC)

**This is much gentler than [MIT Math for CS](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions), and covers the same material.**

## Contributing

Only edit the `.tex` source files, I will use Github actions to compile and release the PDF files. (work in progress)

To make a change to an exercise, you need to change 2 files:

- one of the chapter files, say `chapter5.tex` for example, and
- make the same change in `all.tex` in the relevant section.

## TODO

- Add [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex)
